I used the above methodology to analyze the dataset and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

SyriaTel is a client looking to combat customer churn. The company provided client data in order to better understand whether a consumer would stop doing business with the company. My goal is to create a machine learning model that can help predict whether a customer will churn given certain data about their usage.

## DATA UNDERSTANDING

The 'churn' column will be used as our target column in this binary classification problem. The dataset contains 3333 rows and 21 columns giving details about each datapoint.

## NEXT STEPS

* What makes a state perform better than its counterparts?
* What are some of the reasons why certain area codes spend more?
* Additionally, it would be useful to have more current data, as the dataset used to train and test our model is from 2012.
